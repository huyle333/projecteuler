============

First thing I heard in sophomore year in college to get better.

```
Do ProjectEuler.

I haven't gotten in attempting too many problems, but I guess I'll try
to do as much as I can.

Witness some of the worst scripts you'll ever see. Some of the most
shoddy pieces of code in the history of man.
